    description: `An SPA is a web app that dynamically updates the current page without full reloads. It fetches data from the server and rewrites the page using JavaScript. Key features include:
    Efficient Transitions: SPAs avoid full page reloads.
    Client-Side Rendering: All necessary assets load upfront.
    Popular Frameworks: AngularJS, React, Vue.js.
    No Page Refresh: SPAs maintain state within the client browser.
    API Integration: SPAs communicate with APIs.
    In summary, an API-driven SPA enhances user interactions.`,
